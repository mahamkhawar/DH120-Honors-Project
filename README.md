# World Cup Kick-Off: A Twitter Snapshot of the First Day
## Project Description & Rationale:

Our overall teamâ€™s topic is exploring tweets related to 2022 Qatar FIFA World Cup, from
a dataset which added tweets everyday for a period that lasted the entire duration of the game.
Thus, for this honors project, I chose to single out the first day of the tournament and dive into
what the main topics and sentiments were from that day, particularly with a focus on whether
humanitarian rights were addressed in online discourse. My rationale for this section is due to the
fact that these human rights violations occurred before the tournament began, with the
construction of the stadium and infrastructure needed for an event which hosts over 1.4 million
visitors (Qatar 2022). Thus, by looking into the first day when games had just begun, I wanted
to explore what users initial reactions and feelings towards the tournament and its host country
were prior to being influenced by the actual game.

My research questions include: (1) what were the sentiments on the first day of the
tournament, and was there a humanitarian focus, and (2) what were the trending discussions on
the first day of the cup, and was there a humanitarian focus? I chose these research questions as I
was curious to see what trending topics occurred on the first day of the tournament, and how they
may correlate to events happening on that day or prior to such. Additionally, I explored
sentiments to see how they might correlate with these trending topics as well.

##Significance: 

This project is important because it helps readers understand the global impact that the
world cup has, as well as the gruesome implications it results in. The world cup, as is any giant
international event, often results in the discrimination and abuse of marginalized communities
who suffer from government negligence due to the capitalist focus on the tournament. Most of
these human rights violations happen before the tournament even begins, mostly due to the
grueling work conditions that workers face when constructing the stadium. In Qatar specifically,
migrant worker abuse is no strange occurrence, as they make up 90% of the work force, known
as the kafala system. With international concern regarding the building of the infrastructure
needed for the tournament, Qatar did announce major reforms for the kafala system, however
actual implementation of many of these claims did not occur (Freedom House).

Part of the this project looks into initial reactions to the cup, and if there was an emphasis
on human rights violations, particularly among tweets rated as negative sentiments. This project
will help inform readers on whether there was international concern through social media, and
potential reasons of why this may or may not be.
